1. Unusual memory layout with _start at higher offset 
2. Identication of pushfq and popfq instruction and XOR decryption showing the challenge required unpacking
3. Step 2: Trace Multi-Stage Unpacking
The binary uses multiple unpacking stages:

- Stage 1: Initial XOR decryption → jumps to Stage 2
- Stage 2: Secondary decryption → jumps to Stage 3
- Stage 3: Continues decryption → jumps to Stage 4
- Stages 4-N: Progressive decryption through many stages
- Final Stage: Last unpacking stage around offset +490

3: Each stage follows the pattern:
```asm
pushfq/pushf          ; Save flags
push rax              ; Save register
movabs rax, [XOR_KEY] ; Load decryption key
xor [target], rax     ; Decrypt memory
pop rax               ; Restore register  
popfq/popf            ; Restore flags
jmp main_exec         ; Jump to newly decrypted code
```

4. Dynamic Analysis Strategy
Set breakpoints at the end of each unpacking stage
Follow each jump back to main_exec to see newly decrypted code
Continue through all stages until reaching the actual program logic

5. Decode compare instruction 
The final unpacking stages reveal that the pushfq/popfq instructions unpack each CMP instruction byte by byte during runtime. The program dynamically decrypts comparison operations as it validates each character of the input flag.
