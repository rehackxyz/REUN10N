The challenge uses GraphQL. By sniffing the properties, we can see login functions, user properties and post functions. By checking the receipt with the owner information, we gathered a temporary admin login information and a user stating that he has a secret diary. By login as a admin, we can check against the user secret note by accessing `secretRecipe` to discover the flag.


Flag: brunner{Gr4phQL_1ntR0sp3ct10n_G035_R0UnD_4Nd_r0uND}
