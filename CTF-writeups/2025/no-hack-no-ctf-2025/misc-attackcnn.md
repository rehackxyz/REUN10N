We are given two models and its performance. The goal is to make an image that makes YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 give different results. The challenge gives us the conditions, so we just need to write a script that keeps trying to attack the image until the conditions are true. I chose to use PGD because it is more accurate but you can use others like FGSM is you are in a rush.
