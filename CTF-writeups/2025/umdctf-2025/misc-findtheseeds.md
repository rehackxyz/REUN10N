# Solution
The challenge involves a Python script that encrypts a flag using an XOR stream cipher. The seed for the random number generator is based on the current Unix timestamp. By trying timestamps within a reasonable window (the last 7 days), we can reproduce the keystream and decrypt the ciphertext. The provided solution script automates this process.

Flag: `UMDCTF{pseudo_entropy_hidden_seed}`
