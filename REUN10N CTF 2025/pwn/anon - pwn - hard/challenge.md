Question:
A symphony of broken memories echoes through the heap...

You've discovered an advanced note management system that stores your secrets. 
But something feels... fragmented. Can you orchestrate the perfect exploit 
to reveal what's hidden in the chorus?

The binary includes multiple protections:
- Stack canaries
- Safe unlink checks  
- Checksum validation
- Entropy-based randomization

Download the binary and pwn it locally on your machine.

Requirements:
- Linux x86-64
- Kali Linux VM recommended
- No remote server - this is a standalone binary
